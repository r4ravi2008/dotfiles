targets: ["*"]

# Project Specification

If you were to break this project down into sprints and tasks, how would you do it (timeline info does not need included and doesn't matter).

## Requirements

- Every task/ticket should be an atomic, commitable piece of work with tests (and if tests don't make sense another form of validation that it was completed successfully)
- Every sprint should result in a demoable piece of software that can be run, tested, and build on top of previous work/sprints
- Be exhaustive, be clear, be technical
- Always focus on small atomic tasks that compose up into a clear goal for the sprint

## Process

Once you're done, provide this prompt to a subagent to review your work and suggest improvements. When you're done reviewing the suggested improvements, write your tasks/tickets, sprint plans, etc to a markdown file.
